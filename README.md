In this project, an agricultural assistant was made with special modeling made with flask, openai api key, OpenCV and YOLO. 
Thanks to the special model I made on strawberries, it can determine whether the strawberry is ripe or not and download it to your phone or computer. 
It also allows farmers to ask questions with the chatbot part. I shared the YOLO 8 model and my own special model (best.pt). 
You can also use the YOLO model if you want. 

self.model = YOLO(“best.pt”) --> you can write yolov8n.pt instead.

Before use :

1) install pip ultralytics 
2) Install pip Flask
3) Install pip openai
4) pip install opencv-python

Download it from the terminal.
